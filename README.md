# ML4DQM Evaluation Test

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the ML4DQM evaluation test.  
The task was to classify synthetic CMS HCAL datasets using a Vision Transformer (ViT)-like architecture.

## Files
- `ML4DQM_ViT_test.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with data preparation, model training, evaluation, and ROC curve.
- `ML4DQM_ViT_test.pdf` – PDF export of the notebook for submission.

## Datasets
The datasets used are synthetic and provided by the ML4DQM evaluation test:  
- Run355456_Dataset_jqkne.npy  
- Run357479_Dataset_iodic.npy  

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install required packages: `numpy`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.
3. Run the notebook in any Python environment supporting Jupyter notebooks.
